# Used-Car-Pricing-Prediction
Exploring Used Car Price Prediction Model with Random Forest and Regularization.

I used R for data visualization, data imputation and model selection. 

The primary packages involved are Hmisc, ggplot2, randomForest and glmnet.

We are seeking feature selection and prediction algorithm using Random Forst and regularization techniques. The methods are Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net regression.

It turns out that Elastic Model can drasitically reduce dimesions as well as maintaining good predictive power.
